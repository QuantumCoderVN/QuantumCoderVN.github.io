Hello! I’m Dinh Nhu Duc, a student at INSA Centre Val de Loire, France, majoring in GSI (Génie des Systèmes Industriels). My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, and Quantum Computing, with a strong focus on Quantum Machine Learning.

I am passionate about exploring how quantum algorithms can enhance AI models, pushing the boundaries of computational capabilities to solve complex problems more efficiently. I am constantly learning and experimenting with ways to bridge the gap between classical machine learning and quantum computing, aiming to contribute to the advancement of this emerging field.

Beyond my studies, I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects, discussing new technological breakthroughs, and connecting with like-minded individuals. If you share similar interests or have exciting ideas to exchange, feel free to reach out!
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
